# GPT From Scratch

## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to building a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model from scratch, following the guidance and insights provided by Andrej Karpathy in his video series. The goal of this project is not just to replicate the functionalities of existing GPT models but to deeply understand the underlying mechanics, optimizations, and challenges involved in developing such a powerful language model.

### Inspiration

The project is inspired by Andrej Karpathy's video series on creating a GPT model from the ground up. The series provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the concepts, code, and considerations necessary to build a functioning GPT model. You can find the video series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY).

## Features

- **Model Architecture**: Detailed implementation of the transformer architecture that powers GPT, including self-attention mechanisms, layer normalization, and more.
- **Training Pipeline**: A step-by-step guide on preparing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Exploration of various optimization strategies to enhance model performance and efficiency.
- **Real-world Applications**: Demonstration of the model's capabilities through a set of predefined tasks.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow (optional), NumPy, and others as needed.
- **Tools**: Git for version control, Docker for containerization (optional).
