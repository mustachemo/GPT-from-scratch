# Transformer Implementations Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to hosting various implementations of the Transformer model, as introduced in the landmark paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. The Transformer architecture is designed for high performance in sequence-to-sequence tasks, leveraging self-attention mechanisms for superior handling of dependencies in data. This repository serves as a collective resource for different flavors and adaptations of the Transformer model, facilitating exploration and innovation in neural network architectures.

## Repository Structure

Each sub-directory within this repository contains a unique implementation of the Transformer model. These implementations may vary by application, programming language, or the use of different frameworks and libraries. Here is what you can find in each:

- `harvard-nlp/`: Based on the "The Annotated Transformer" from Harvard NLP, providing a step-by-step guide to building the Transformer from scratch.
- `other-implementations/`: Placeholder for other diverse Transformer model implementations.
